* Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. This project utilizes K-means clustering to classify customers based on their purchasing behavior. The resulting clusters help in identifying distinct customer groups for targeted marketing campaigns.

* Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customers' purchasing data, including features such as:

Customer ID
Age
Gender
Annual Income
Spending Score
Purchase History
* Model Architecture
The model uses K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups. The steps involved are:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for clustering.
Feature Scaling: Normalizing the features to ensure equal weight in clustering.
K-means Clustering: Applying the K-means algorithm to group customers into clusters.
Training
The model was trained using the following steps:

*Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender).
Normalize features.
Model Training:

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
Apply K-means clustering to segment the customers.
* Results
The model successfully segments customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior. Each cluster represents a unique group of customers with similar characteristics, enabling targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.
